refactor: Remove Oxidized dependency, use Git for config version management

- Remove oxidized service from docker-compose.yml
- Delete app/services/oxidized_service.py
- Remove OXIDIZED_URL from app/config.py
- Remove oxidized_service import from app/services/__init__.py
- Remove oxidized related API endpoints from configurations.py
- Remove oxidized models from schemas.py
- Update tests/unit/test_configurations.py
- Update README.md and documentation files
- Update docs/diff-change.md with change records

The system now uses Git directly for network device configuration
version management, no longer depends on external Oxidized service.
